# Diabetes Prediction System

## 📌 Description
This project is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical parameters. It demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and deployment.

## ✅ Features
- Reads and preprocesses diabetes dataset (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes Database).
- Trains a classification model to predict diabetes risk.
- Uses Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy).
- Outputs prediction results for new patient data.
- Simple CLI or web interface for input (describe your interface here).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib (if used)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaishnaoVaidya/diabetes_prediction_system.git
   cd diabetes_prediction_system
